We use modern technologies to learn best practices for real-world software development.

# Branch Naming Convention
To keep our Git repository organized and readable, we follow a structured branch naming convention inspired by common industry practices. Each branch name starts with a type prefix followed by a short, descriptive name:

| Prefix      | Purpose                                               |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `feat/`     | New features or major changes                         |
| `fix/`      | Bug fixes                                             |
| `docs/`     | Documentation updates                                 |
| `chore/`    | Maintenance tasks (e.g., dependency updates, cleanup) |
| `refactor/` | Code changes that do not affect behavior              |
| `test/`     | Adding or modifying tests                             |
